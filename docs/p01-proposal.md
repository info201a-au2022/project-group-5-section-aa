### Abstract
Our main question is _how do maternal mortality rates differ among different geographic regions and racial/ethnic groups within the United States_. To address the question, we will obtain data revealing maternal mortality trends relating to the rates at which they occur and which populations/ geographic regions they primarily affect. We are concerned with the issue of maternal morality trends because data relating to the issue has the potential to highlight health inequities that must be addressed.

### Keywords
_Maternal mortality; minorities; race; ethnicity; childbirth_

### Introduction
The CDC defines maternal mortality as the death of a woman during pregnancy, at delivery, or shortly following delivery. There has been an increase in maternal mortality rates between 2018 and 2020. In 2020, non-Hispanic Black women experienced maternal mortality at nearly three times the rate of non-Hispanic White women and three times the rate of Hispanic women. This pattern of Black women representing a disproportionate majority of maternal mortality amongst women is one our project seeks to explore. Our goal is to further understand what areas are more likely to experience significantly higher maternal mortality. Additionally, in doing so, we will be able to explore to what extent geographical location impacts a woman's likelihood of experiencing maternal mortality. With these explorations in mind, our project will look at patterns in geographical location alongside looking at its association amongst different racial and/or ethnic groups.  

### Problem Domain
- Project Framing: In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the United States was one of only two countries to report a significant increase in maternal mortality ratio since 2000. Since the WHO report was released, U.S. maternal mortality rates have leveled in recent years, but the ratio remains significantly higher than in other “developed” countries. Through this project, we will highlight and analyze data similar to what has been highlighted by the WHO report on maternal mortality and the prevalence at which it occurs. More specifically, our project will focus on how the perveance of maternal mortality directly correlates with social determinants such as race, ethnicity, and geographic location. Several studies indicate that social factors, specifically race, play a detrimental role in maternal mortality. Black women in the U.S. have a significantly higher risk of experiencing maternal mortality. Therefore, the aim of the project is to highlight and address the health inequity of maternal mortality and its disproportionate impacts.  

- Human Values: Equity, Health, Accountability, Responsibility, Integrity

- Direct and Indirect Stakeholders: Direct stakeholders for this project could include researchers collecting data on the prevalence of maternal mortality and how it correlates with social factors such as race and geographic location. Once our project is completed, the data and information we collect will become accessible to anyone seeking information on the research topic. Indirect stakeholders of the project will include women who have been or will be impacted by maternal mortality, more specifically Black women as this population is most impacted by the issue. Since maternal mortality can affect almost any woman during childbirth, more often Black women, the data we collect has the potential to highlight the issue and impact decision making on various levels such as on a policy level.

### Research Questions
- How do maternal mortality rates differ across the US?  

 - This question is important because it is the backbone of our research exploration. There is a fair amount of variation across state lines from political leaning to population density that may potentially impact how we understand the issue of maternal mortality. When trying to understand the severity of maternal mortality, it's important to understand the concentration of maternal mortality across different geographical lines.  


- How do maternal mortality rates differ based on ethnicity and race?

 - Healthcare is an area that often underserves minorities, exposing them to unsafe or neglectful healthcare conditions. Similar to the question above, understanding how ethnicity and race plays a role in maternal mortality provides a more complete picture. It allows us to understand the varying prevalence of the issue amongst different women.  


- Based on the geographical patterns of maternal mortality, what are the factors of a state that potentially explain why we’re seeing these patterns?

 - It’s important to consider the components of a given state in terms of population, political leaning, etc. To understand why we’re seeing higher levels of maternal mortality in certain areas, it may help to have these other variables. This will potentially further strengthen our argument of racial issues as the explanatory variable behind high maternal mortality amongst minorities.  

### The Dataset
- These datasets will help us with the goal of answering all three research questions and addressing certain aspects presented in the problem domain. For the first research question, the second dataset will be used since this is its primary function. For the second question, both datasets present statistics on different ethnicities and races. For the third question, we will infer from given columns that can help us answer these questions. Columns such as resident status, occupation, education, etc. This third question will specifically be answered with the help of visualizations we create and our interpretations of them.

- The first dataset is taken from Kaggle by a user who had sourced it originally from the World Health Organization. This includes data from the year 2000 to 2017 for the purpose of making a plan to reduce the amount of preventable maternal mortalities. This project was funded by the World Health Organization for the benefit of research and countries all around the world. Due to this, we can determine that the source is credible and is updated on a fairly frequent term. The second dataset is taken from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics website. It is sourced from the National Vital Statistics System for the purpose of studying maternal mortality rates and making them easily accessible to others. It is updated yearly, with this specific dataset being from 2020. Its mission being to automate the entry, classification, and retrieval of cause-of-death information. This dataset is funded by the CDC and in turn the US government for this purpose; meaning that they are the ones who benefit the most from it and are trustworthy.   

### Expected Implications
The ultimate goal of this project is to highlight maternal mortality as an issue that is exacerbated by social factors such as race. Therefore, the expected implication of the project will be an overall better understanding of how maternal mortality rates differ among populations in different geographic regions. This will hopefully highlight health inequity and educate people on the pressing issue that is maternal mortality. Ideally, we also hope that the data we collect pushes professionals that that are bettered positioned to properly address the issue. This will include policy makers that make decisions regarding factors that influence maternal mortality and physicians that perform birthing surgical procedures.  

### Limitations
Potential limitations we may need to address would be differing reporting inconsistencies across state lines. Different states may have stronger or weaker reports of maternal mortality based on the strength of their healthcare services. Additionally, if a state does strengthen their reporting of healthcare, it is possible that it is not necessarily the case that that state is now experiencing higher rates of maternal mortality but rather that their actual accounting of the instances of maternal mortality has improved. This would make it seem that they’re experiencing more maternal mortality but in reality, their reporting has just improved. Another potential limitation is looking at age and how that potentially plays a factor in maternal mortality rates. Currently, our research questions do not address age but as women get older, there are increased risks associated with pregnancy. If the data we collect shows a correlation between older women representing most maternal mortality rates, that will also be something we need to address to have a comprehensive understanding of our data.
