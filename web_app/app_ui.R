                        The purpose of these two charts is to provide insight into how the rate of infant and fetal deaths differs across county lines in the state of Washington. 
                        Counties ranked among the lowest per capita personal income have little to no data regarding
                          infant deaths to draw conclusions from. Trends we can see throughout this data is that overall, there is fluctuation in the rate of 
                          infant and fetal deaths across counties. Notably, in recent years, Pierce has seen a decline in both infant and fetal deaths. 
                          Washington's Office of Financial Management depicts that in both 2010 and 2020, King County was ranked one of the top two counties with the highest 
                          per capita personal income hence why it was deemed important to include this county in the visualization. Ultimately, these charts and the information
                          from Washington's Office of Financial Management both reflect the same story of how financial disparities play a large role in healthcare. 
                          Counties with low per capita personal income often had little to no data regarding infant and fetal death while counties with high per capita 
                          personal income had robust data. These financial disparities impact those living in low-income areas and the lack of representation they receive."))
