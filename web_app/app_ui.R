               as race and geographic location. Several studies indicate that social factors such as race

               maternal mortality especially in states with notoriously high concentrations of Black indivduals.

                          infant deaths to draw conclusions from. Trends we can see throughout this data is that overall, there is fluctuation in the rate of 
                          infant and fetal deaths across counties. Notably, in recent years, Pierce has seen a decline in both infant and fetal deaths. 
                          Washington's Office of Finanical Management depicts that in both 2010 and 2020, King County was ranked one of the top two counties with the highest

                          from the Washington's Office of Finanical Management both reflect the same story of how financial disparities play a large role in healthcare. 
                          Counties with low per capita personal income often had little to no data regarding infant and fetal death while counties with high per capita
